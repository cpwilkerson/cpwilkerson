### Who I am as a developer
Hello, I'm Christian Wilkerson.  I've been a professional software developer
since 1996.  I've seen a lot tech come, and go.  My titles have always included
*programmer*, or *software engineer*, but I've been everything from 
**full-stack engineer**, to I.T. guy, to hand holder.  Now I lead a team of
developers, which seems to mean that I'm a professional meeting attender, and
work delegater.

My career has mainly centered around Windows development.  Then, one day in 
2012 my wife bought me an **iPhone 4s**.  It was my first *iOS* device, and it
changed everything for me.  It was the gateway drug that lead to iPads,
a newer iPhone, and Macs.  My love affair with all things mobile also morphed 
into web development.  A guy at my office introduced me to **node.js** and 
changed my world again.  I had written my own tcp/ip server.  I understand
multi-threaded programming.  But when I saw that *Javascript* really had no more
boundaries...my world had changed again.

Fast-forward to today, and I find the only way I want to write front-end code is
with *ReactJS*.  I realize now the fleeting nature of web frameworks.  Just a
few years ago, everyone was crazy about *jQuery*.

### My Github
My Github page is fairly sparse right now.  But my intention is to fill it with
projects that not only demonstrate my skills, but hopefully provide meaningful
examples of how certain frameworks, and languages work.  I've had a great career
so far, and despite it sounding cliche...I want to give something back.

[codableScratch](https://github.com/cpwilkerson/codableScratch)
* Small project that demonstrates how to work with the **Codable** protocol in
  **Swift**

[login-server](https://github.com/cpwilkerson/login-server)
* **WIP**: I needed to understand **JSON Web Tokens**, when this project is done
  it will demonstrate not only *JWTs*, you will see **NodeJS, ReactJS, Redux,
  Bootstrap, as well as, a small glimpse into my web development workflow.
* **FYI**: I have actually already implemented this in the real world, but that
  code is proprietary to the company I wrote it for.  This project is a 
  sanitized version that simply demonstrates the aforementioned javascript 
  tools.
