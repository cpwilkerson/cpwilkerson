      <h3>Who I am as a developer</h3>
        <p>
          Hello, I'm Christian Wilkerson.  I've been a professional software
          developer since 1996.  I've seen a lot tech come, and go.  My titles
          have always included <em>programmer</em>, or <em>software engineer</em>, but I've
          been everything from <strong>full-stack engineer</strong>, to I.T. guy, to hand
          holder. These days, I lead a team of developers. This means making
          decisions on who writes what code, as well as, mentoring junior
          developors. It's challenging, but also very rewarding.
        </p>
        <p>My career had mainly centered around Windows development.
          Then, one day in 2012 my wife bought me an <strong>iPhone 4s</strong>.  It was my
          first <em>iOS</em> device, and it changed everything for me.  It was the
          gateway drug that lead to iPads, a newer iPhone, and Macs.  My
          love affair with all things mobile also morphed into web
          development.  A guy at my office introduced me to <strong>node.js</strong> and
          changed my world again.  In early 2000's, I had written my own
          tcp/ip server.  I understand multi-threaded programming.  Back then,
          javascript was just a way to gussy up your static page. But when
          I saw that <em>Javascript</em> really had no more boundaries...my world had
          changed again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast-forward to today, and I find the only way I want to write
          front-end code is with <em>ReactJS</em>.  I realize now the fleeting nature of web frameworks.  Just a
          few years ago, everyone was crazy about <em>jQuery</em>.  Okay...until the next crazy
          awesome framework comes along, I'm on team React.
        </p>
        <h3>My Github</h3>
        <p>
          My Github page is fairly sparse right now.  But my intention is to fill it with
          projects that not only demonstrate my skills, but hopefully provide meaningful
          examples of how certain frameworks, and languages work.  I've had a great career
          so far, and despite it sounding cliche...I want to give something back.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Small project that demonstrates how to work with the 
            <strong>Codable</strong> protocol in
            <strong>Swift</strong>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>WIP</strong>: I needed to understand <strong>JSON Web Tokens</strong>, when this project is done
            it will demonstrate not only <em>JWTs</em>, you will see **NodeJS, ReactJS, Redux,
            Bootstrap, as well as, a small glimpse into my web development workflow.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>FYI</strong>: I have actually already implemented this in the real world, but that
            code is proprietary to the company I wrote it for.  This project is a
            sanitized version that simply demonstrates the aforementioned javascript
            tools.
