    <h3>Who I am as a developer</h3>
      <p>
        Hello, I'm Christian Wilkerson.  I've been a professional software developer
        <br>since 1996.  I've seen a lot tech come, and go.  My titles have always included<br>
        <em>programmer</em>, or <em>software engineer</em>, but I've been everything from<br>
        <strong>full-stack engineer</strong>, to I.T. guy, to hand holder.  Now I lead a team of<br>
        developers. Practically speaking, I go to a lot of meetings now, and read more code than<br>
        I write.
      </p>
      <p>My career had mainly centered around Windows development.  Then, one day in<br>
        2012 my wife bought me an <strong>iPhone 4s</strong>.  It was my first <em>iOS</em> device, and it<br>
        changed everything for me.  It was the gateway drug that lead to iPads,<br>
        a newer iPhone, and Macs.  My love affair with all things mobile also morphed<br>
        into web development.  A guy at my office introduced me to <strong>node.js</strong> and<br>
        changed my world again.  In early 2000's, I had written my own tcp/ip server.  I understand<br>
        multi-threaded programming.  Back then, javascript was just a way to gussy up your static page.<br>
        But when I saw that <em>Javascript</em> really had no more boundaries...my world had changed again.<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast-forward to today, and I find the only way I want to write front-end code is<br>
        with <em>ReactJS</em>.  I realize now the fleeting nature of web frameworks.  Just a<br>
        few years ago, everyone was crazy about <em>jQuery</em>.  Okay...until the next crazy<br>
        awesome framework comes along, I'm on team React.
      </p>
      <h3>My Github</h3>
      <p>
        My Github page is fairly sparse right now.  But my intention is to fill it with<br>
        projects that not only demonstrate my skills, but hopefully provide meaningful<br>
        examples of how certain frameworks, and languages work.  I've had a great career<br>
        so far, and despite it sounding cliche...I want to give something back.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Small project that demonstrates how to work with the 
          <strong>Codable</strong> protocol in<br>
          <strong>Swift</strong>
        </li>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>WIP</strong>: I needed to understand <strong>JSON Web Tokens</strong>, when this project is done<br>
          it will demonstrate not only <em>JWTs</em>, you will see **NodeJS, ReactJS, Redux,<br>
          Bootstrap, as well as, a small glimpse into my web development workflow.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>FYI</strong>: I have actually already implemented this in the real world, but that<br>
          code is proprietary to the company I wrote it for.  This project is a<br>
          sanitized version that simply demonstrates the aforementioned javascript<br>
          tools.
